This is the Cinema Room REST Service with Java project I made as part of [Java Backend Developer (Spring Boot)](https://hyperskill.org/courses/12-java-backend-developer-spring-boot)

Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? The idea of a ticket booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please
